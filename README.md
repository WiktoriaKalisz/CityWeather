## UX Principles Applied

The design of CityWeather incorporates few key UX principles to create an intuitive and user-friendly experience:

- **Aesthetic-Usability Effect**  
Visually pleasing UI with soft gradients and clean typography improves perceived usability.

- **Law of Proximity**  
Related weather data is grouped closely together, making it easier to scan and understand.

- **Mental Model & Jakob’s Law**  
The interface follows user expectations based on other weather apps, minimizing the learning curve.

- **Cognitive Load Reduction**  
Simple layout, limited options, and large icons make it easy to interact with the content.
